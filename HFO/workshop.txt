description=[h1]NEW MODELS AND TEXTURES[/h1]
description=Every vanilla gun, magazine, ammo type, ammo box, attachment, gun case, and related items got a model/texture overhaul. Additionally, the pistol cases can be attached to pistol case slots and the new repair/cleaning kits can be attached to gear slots. The Sawnoff shotguns can also be attached to holsters.

description=
description=[h1]FIREARM REBALANCE[/h1]
description=Every firearm and attachment was tweaked in some capacity. Damage, Range, Aiming Time, Crit Chance, Hit Chance, Recoil, and much more to fit a bit more honed in firearm experience. No more shooting forward and somehow hitting the zombie at your hip 20 tiles away after sprinting down the road.
description=
description=[h1]CLEANING MECHANIC[/h1]
description=Through the introduction of a cleaning kit and new firarm lubricant you can clean your firearms to subsidize repairs. It will require an aiming skill of 3-4 depending on the firearm. Combine those 2 items with a ripped sheet to clean your firearm. This will give back a small portion of condition without adding to your repair number. It will also have a small chance to reduce your repair count by 1, the chance to repair is influenced by your aiming skill.
description=
description=[i]The level of condition given back and chance to repair can be influenced by sandbox options.[/i]

description=
description=[h1]AMMO CANS[/h1]
description=An ammo can item was added to the loot pool. The unopened version found will have a randomizer function that when opened you will recieve some randomized ammo. You will also retain an empty version of the ammo can to use as a container.
description=
description=[h1]ADDITIONAL FIREARM MECHANICS[/h1]
description=[h2] Melee Mode [/h2]
description=With a press of a hotkey or the click of the radial menu, every vanilla firearm can be swapped into melee mode. Swapping between modes will retain any and all information, repair count, condition, attachments, ammo, and even if it was jammed before. The firearm will get its condition lowered like any other melee weapon. A usable bayonet will increase range + melee damage if attached.

description=
description=[h2] Weapon Light [/h2]
description=A small portion of firearm attachments have a built in light. This can be toggled via a hotkey or through the radial menu. When on, you will have a small surrounding light which will act more light a flashlight when you aim your firearm.
description=

description=
description=[h2] Fire Mode Toggle [/h2]
description=At the moment, this has minimal influence, but you can select your firemode with a firearm with a hotkey or through the radial menu. As the addition grows so will this function.

description=
description=[h1]Sandbox Options[/h1]
description=My understanding is that everybody plays the game differently. Having a variety of sandbox options helps tweak to your hearts content. More options may come to light in the future but for now:[b]
description=[list]
description=  [*]Vanilla Loot spawns were not tweaked, the general game options will impact the regular spawns for vanilla firearms, attachments, and ammo
description=
description=  [*]Addtional loot locations were added for Firearms and Attachments but you will need to turn that setting on
description=
description=  [*]Loot Distribution is managed by (Loot Setting * Spawn Multiplier * rarity). Rarity can be found in the loot lua file but is between .1 and .001
description=
description=  [*]New Cleaning mechanics can be influenced in settings to add more condition on cleaning or higher chance to reduce repair count
description=
description=  [*]A few custom weapon skins were added and more will come over time. You can turn on spawns for these to add to the loot pools.
description=
description=  [*]A full range of stat changes could be made accross all the vanilla guns.
description=[/list]
description=[/b]
description=
description=[h1]Additional Information[/h1]
description=The mod was tested in various environments but there is no possible way to accommodate every single mod or server setup. There should be no expectations for cross compatibility on a larger scale among the pool of mods for this game. On that note, this is a vanilla gun replacement + more so anything that does similar things will not work together[b]
description=[list]
description=  [*]Not compatible with VFE or other firearm mods that replace vanilla guns
description=  [*]B41.78+ Single Player / Multiplayer Compatible
description=  [*]You can influence mechanics directly through sandbox settings
